# Venice Local

Welcome to Venice Local! This is our 2025-2026 FBLA Coding & Programming Project. Venice Local is a desktop application designed to help users discover and support small, local businesses in Venice, Florida.

Local business owners can add their businesses to the app, and community members can browse listings, leave reviews, and save their favorite places. If a business is offering a special deal or promotion, it will be displayed on the business's listing. The app uses a backend created with Supabase to securely store business listings, reviews, and user data so information is saved and updated in real time. The goal of this project is to strengthen the local community by making it easier for people to find and support nearby businesses. All business entries represent real small local businesses in Downtown Venice, FL, and details (hours, descriptions, addresses, photos, etc.) were gathered from TripAdvisor and Yelp.

## Get the Project
- GitHub: https://github.com/EmmaNguyen915/FBLA-4th (Code -> Download ZIP) or `git clone https://github.com/EmmaNguyen915/FBLA-4th.git`
- Make sure Node.js 18+ is installed (macOS: `brew install node`, Windows: download from nodejs.org).

## Open and Run (source code)
1) Download or clone the repo, then open Terminal or PowerShell in the project folder.  
2) Install dependencies once: `npm install`.  
3) Launch the app from source: `npm start`. Electron opens a Venice Local window using the local code.

## Build an Installer/App
1) Complete steps 1-2 above.  
2) Build a packaged app: `npm run dist` (creates output in `dist/`).  
3) macOS: open the `.dmg` in `dist`, then drag Venice Local into Applications.  
4) Windows: run the `.exe` in `dist` and follow the installer prompts.  
5) After installation, open Venice Local like a normal app; no terminal needed.
